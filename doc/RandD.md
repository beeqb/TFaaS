### R&D topics

- model conversion: PyTorch, fast.ai models to TensorFlow model
- model repository: implement persistent model storage, versioning, tagging, etc.
- TFaaS clustering: explore kubernetes and auto-scaling
- training model with distributed data: read CMS ROOT files and feed them into TFaaS for continuous training

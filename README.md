### TensorFlow as a Service (TFaaS) for CMS experiment

Deep Learning Networks (DNN) penetrate aim to improve our understanding of
underlying problems based on digital footprint. CMS experiment at CERN use
various Machine Learning (ML) techniques, including DNN, in various physics and
computing related projects. The popularity of TensorFlow Google framework make
it excellent choice to apply ML algorithms for using in CMS workflow pipeline.
The intend of this project is to build end-to-end solution within CMSSW
framework and apply TF trained model into production.
